##SQL Framework

I chose Mysql as my database framework because PHP works better with Mysql and Mysql runs very fast with PHP and I also had to use cleardb extension which supports mysql commands for the heroku server.

##Server Framework

I chose the server framework as php.
I chose php because I had worked on php and had built basic apps using its MVC framework.
It is easy to build apps on php for beginners and the language is easy to learn.

##Client Framework

I chose javascript and jquery as the client side framework. I chose javascript as it is one of the best client side frameworks and Jquery can be
 used very easily to manipulate the DOM as its sole purpose is to manipulate DOM. So for displaying Ajax calls from the table I used JQuery methods.
 I used Jquery animate method to animate the data.
 

##Easy Stuff

Making Ajax calls , displaying getting the response, showing the table data in unordered list was easy. I was familiar with ajax calls so it made my work easy.
I have previously worked using ajax and displaying data through jquery which made the task easier. 

##Hard stuff

I was not familiar with API calls so I had to familiarize myself with it using PHP curl.I had trouble inserting the api data into table but later I found out using implode function which joins each value .
Getting the ajax timeout was tricky.
As heroku does not support mysql so I had to use cleardb extension and update my connections in the code accordingly.

##other components

I used XAMPP(Apache, mysql,php,perl) package which made my work easy working with database and php simultaneously.

##using it professionally

If I had to use it professionally my biggest concern would be the framework of PHP which suits better for the clients needs.
There are many PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter which is old, Laravel and magento are much in demand. Depending on the clients need I would choose the framework which makes my task easier to code the particular thing and it should support the MVC paradigm so as to differentiate between the views and controllers.
